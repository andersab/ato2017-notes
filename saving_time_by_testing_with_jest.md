# What is Jest
* OSS 2014
* Revised in 2015/2016
* Works extremely well with React.js but works with all

# What problems does it solve

## What challenges
* many environments
* Async code
* User interface code is hard to test

## Honorable Mentionables

* **Test Runners**: Mocha, Jasmine, Karma
* **Test Libraries**: Chai

## Disadvantages
* Jest does not test every environment
* Jest is not simple
* Jest is still growing and changing

# How can it save me time

## Setting up Tests
* 1 Depdendency for Test Runner, assertion library, code coverage
* No extra config
* Familiar syntax, like Jasmine
* Great mocking + assertion APIs
* Snapshot Tests!

**Will not run in node by default, doesn't support ES6**
*Needs babel*

**Jest** controls babel transformation
*Codemod* - helps change other test framework files to Jest
